# ## Github

# [Github](https://github.com) is a website that allows you to easily create public git repositories. Students are also able to create private git repositories.
# 
# You should sign up to github when you have the chance, however you do not need to for the next step.
# 
# Clone the repository containing this document:
# 
# ```
# git clone https://github.com/b-trav/GitTutorial.git
# ```

# ## Repository

# - A repository is a store of all the versions of all the files in a git project (directory).
# - A repository can either be a _working_ repository, or a _bare_ repository.
# - Working repositories have all your files in them, but they also have a sub-directory called `.git` which contains all the versions of your work.
# - A bare repository is simply the .git folder on its own - normally called `ProjectName.git`

# ## Cloning a repository

# ```
# git clone https://github.com/b-trav/GitTutorial.git
# ```

# ## Creating a repository

# Rather than cloning a repository, you can make your current directory into a git project by simply typing:
# ```
# git init
# ```
